"The values for Q1 and Q3 for the data set below are Q1=118 and Q3=161. Are there any outliers for this data? If so, what are they?"
[45,94,117,117,127,128,142,144,147,153,161,161,172,195,211]
IQR value = 161-118 = 43
Lower limit for outlier = 118 - 1.5*43 = 53.5
Upper limit for outlier = 161 +43*1.5 = 225.5
Anything outside (53.5,225.5 ) are outliers
so outliers are 45
so answer is (b)


If the test scores of a class of 36 students have a mean of 71.2 and the test scores of another class of 28 students have a mean of 67.6, then the mean of the combined group is
(36*71.2)+(28*67.6)/(36+28)
