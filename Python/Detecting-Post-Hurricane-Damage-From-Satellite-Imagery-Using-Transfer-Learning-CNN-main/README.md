# Detecting-Post-Hurricane-Damage-From-Satellite-Imagery-Using-Transfer-Learning-CNN


# Motivation

As many of Houstonians, I was impacted by hurricane Harvey as well as my beloved once's. when I started to hear more and more accounts of rescuers being delayed getting to those who needed help, I started to search and think for a safer and faster rescue efforts.

I published a paper regarding this approach [Detecting Damaged Buildings on Post-Hurricane 
Satellite Imagery based on Transfer Learning](https://go.gale.com/ps/i.do?id=GALE%7CA695152561&sid=googleScholar&v=2.1&it=r&linkaccess=abs&issn=13035150&p=AONE&sw=w&userGroupName=anon%7E22824d61) 

# Solution

Machine learning algorithms to identify and classify structural damages caused by floods through satellite images, these models can be used for various fields such as Structural Health Monitoring (SHM), vehicles, rails, and roads.

# Method
Convolution Neural Network (CNN) is used to detect damage and no damage images form satellite imagery using different classifiers. The dataset used belongs to the hurricane Harvey that caused several damages in the Houston area. In addition, 1D-convolutional neural network (CNN) was used to look at the weekend joints of the frames in buildings. The model consisted of CNN with residual learning modules and multi-scale modules was applied to explore the mode shapes by extracting the damaged properties. A spatial relation was founded using Gate Recurrent Unit (GRU) and CNN to detect the damaged parts of the structural building.
